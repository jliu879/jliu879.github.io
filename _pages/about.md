My research focuses on **robust and regret-optimal control**, including $H_2$ / $H_\infty$ preview control and uncertainty-aware controller synthesis.

More specifically, I’m interested in connecting **uncertainty, optimization, and learning** to control and planning, with an emphasis on provable performance and scalable algorithms.

Within the context of preview control and non-causal baselines, I have worked on convergence analysis and controller synthesis methods for both stochastic ($H_2$) and worst-case ($H_\infty$) settings.


Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
