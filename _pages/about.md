My research focuses on **robust and regret-optimal control**, including $H_2$ / $H_\infty$ preview control and uncertainty-aware controller synthesis.

More specifically, I’m interested in connecting **uncertainty, optimization, and learning** to control and planning, with an emphasis on provable performance and scalable algorithms.

Within the context of preview control and non-causal baselines, I have worked on convergence analysis and controller synthesis methods for both stochastic ($H_2$) and worst-case ($H_\infty$) settings.
